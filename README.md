# userList Desktop App

```
I think that some company can use this web site to save users data and to use it for helping users.

### In this project I use:
* *React*
* *Redux*
* *React-Redux*
* *CSS (SCSS)*
* *React router dom* 

It was a good project for me because I could work with **Hooks**, **routing**, **form** and **SCSS**.
